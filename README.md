# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard uses Bootstrap, two OpenWeather API calls including One Call and Geocoding, dynamic HTML, and Day.js to bring you the current weather and five day forecast of the city of your choosing.

## Usage
When the user enters the site,  https://mchughmegan.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/, they will be able to search for the weather of a city using the search box and search button.

A new button will appear below the search box and button with the city's name for future use.

To the right of the search box and city buttons, the user will see the current weather and five day forecast for that city.
